# Steal-Everything-from-USB-Driver

This tool has written to understand basics of 'os' library on python 3 and it provides you copying everything inside of the USB driver to your computer. 

When you run the steal.py, first of all, it scans your computer's harddrivers' names and notes them. Then it continues to scan your computer each 5 seconds and compare the results until it is stopped. If it detects that any usb driver is plugged in, it will copy everything in the USB driver to your computer.

**NOTE:** This tool has written for Windows OS.
